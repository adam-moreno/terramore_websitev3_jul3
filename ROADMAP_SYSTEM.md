# Roadmap System Implementation

## Overview
The roadmap system is a lead generation and data collection mechanism that creates personalized business roadmaps for potential clients. It serves as both a valuable lead magnet and a way to gather detailed information about prospects.

## Components

- **Purpose**: Collects lead information and generates personalized roadmaps
- **Features**:
  - Multi-step form with comprehensive business information
  - Real-time form validation
  - Dynamic roadmap generation based on user inputs
  - Download functionality for generated roadmaps
  - Integration with scheduling system

### 2. Roadmap Hook (`hooks/use-roadmap-modal.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Manages modal state using Zustand
- **Features**:
  - Global state management for roadmap modal
  - Persistent state across page navigation

### 3. API Route (`app/api/roadmap/route.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Handles form submissions and data processing
- **Features**:
  - Form validation
  - Data logging (currently to console)
  - Foundation for email integration
  - Error handling

## Data Collection

- **Challenges**: Tailored solutions for specific pain points
- **Goals**: 90-day actionable steps aligned with objectives

### Roadmap Structure:
1. **Weeks 1-2**: Foundation & Assessment

4. **Weeks 9-12**: Optimization & Scale

## Integration Points

### Current Integrations:

2. **Install the service**:
   ```bash
   pnpm add resend  # or your chosen service
   ```

3. **Update the API route** with actual email sending logic

### 2. Database Integration
To store leads, consider:

1. **Airtable**: Easy setup, great for small teams

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors
pnpm run build

# Check for linting issues
pnpm run lint

# Test API route locally
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/roadmap \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"firstName":"Test","lastName":"User","email":"test@example.com","businessName":"Test Business","industry":"service-business","businessStage":"startup","biggestChallenge":"No leads","goals":"Increase revenue"}'
```
